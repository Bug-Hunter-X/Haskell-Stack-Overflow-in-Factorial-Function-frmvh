This Haskell code attempts to calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive function. However, it contains a subtle bug related to pattern matching and lazy evaluation. The function `factorial'` correctly handles the base case (0!), but the recursive case has an issue. When `n` is negative, it does not immediately return an error but instead goes into an infinite loop, causing a stack overflow.

```haskell
factorial' :: Int -> Integer
factorial' 0 = 1
factorial' n = n * factorial' (n - 1)
```

The problem is that the function doesn't explicitly handle negative input values.  Lazy evaluation in Haskell allows the recursive calls to continue even with invalid input, leading to the stack overflow.  A naive fix such as adding a `otherwise` case won't work because it'll still cause non-termination.
